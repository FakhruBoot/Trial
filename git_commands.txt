1. Creating SSH key and connecting your github account to local computer

First open github and put below command 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<github_email_id>"

This will generate a public and private SSH key for your system.
Save that in default folder and give passphrase if you can remember

Now we check if SSH agent is working
eval $(ssh-agent)

Then you add the SSH key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy the public SSH key to put in github 
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now open github-->settings-->SSH and GPG Keys-->New SSH Key

Give desired name and paste the public key. 
Now your connection is done and you can push your code.

2. Commands to use Git:

git init     		 	--> Initializes git repository
git add .    		 	--> Adds all files in a branch to commit
git add filename	 	--> Adds specefic files to commit
git commit -m "comments" 	--> Commits into the branch
git push origin branchname	--> Pushes the commit in the remote repository in the branch
git merge branchname		--> merges all the pushed commits to the master branch
git branch branchname		--> Creates a new branch
git status			--> Shows which files are left to commit or updated




3.To revert a pushed change in git:

First Method: This will show the revert commit in code. It will change the code/file locally as well
First get the commit id you want to revert from "git log"
Then copy the id and put in " git revert commid_id"
Your commit will revert and git will point to previous change.
Then do git push to implement the revert.

Second Method: This will not show the revert in code but you can see in commits section. It will change the code/file locally as well
do " git revert HEAD"
It will open a editor file where you can change the commit message.
After editing and saving, you will see the command executed.
Then you can push using " git push origin master" and the changes will be reverted and not seen in code but only in commits.

Third Method: This will not show the revert in code as well as commits section. It will be as if you have not committed anything.
This method also saves the file in local repository unlike other 2.
Do "git reset HEAD~1"
Then do "git push -f origin master"
