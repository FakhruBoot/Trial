To revert a pushed change in git:

First Method: This will show the revert commit in code. It will change the code/file locally as well
First get the commit id you want to revert from "git log"
Then copy the id and put in " git revert commid_id"
Your commit will revert and git will point to previous change.
Then do git push to implement the revert.

Second Method: This will not show the revert in code but you can see in commits section. It will change the code/file locally as well
do " git revert HEAD"
It will open a editor file where you can change the commit message.
After editing and saving, you will see the command executed.
Then you can push using " git push origin master" and the changes will be reverted and not seen in code but only in commits.

Third Method: This will not show the revert in code as well as commits section. It will be as if you have not committed anything.
This method also saves the file in local repository unlike other 2.
Do "git reset HEAD~1"
Then do "git push -f origin master"
